# Simple Chatbot with NLP (NLTK & spaCy)

This repository contains a simple yet effective chatbot built using natural language processing (NLP) libraries, specifically NLTK and spaCy. The bot is trained on predefined responses and can interact with users based on keyword matching and intent recognition.

## Features

- **Predefined Responses**: The chatbot is equipped with a set of predefined responses for common interactions like greetings, farewells, and requests for help.
